<strong>Project Proposal:</strong>
<br><br>
Analysis of National Park Attendance over time
By utilizing monthly attendance data from all 62 national parks, we will track attendance over time, comparative attendance between parks in different regions/states, and research a narrative exploring any significant increases or decreases in attendance.
We plan to utilize CSV data of the monthly attendance by park, GEOJSON data for both pin markers and polygons for each park, and historical research into potential socio/economic/political factors influencing significant attendance changes.
